This is my capstone project for Data Science Immersive with General Assembly. The dataset contains the flight records of commerical airlines among US cities during Jan, 2020. It originally has 21 features can be classified to categories of date, time, locations & delay status. 


### **[Capstone, Part 1: Pitch + Problem Statement](./part-01/README.md)**

The main question for the project is to predict that whether a future flight during Janaury will be delayed and what factors have strong impact on the delaying status. 

Based on the question, I decided to use classification algorithms to solve the binary (true or false) question. Also, I also attemptd the TF/IDF model from NLP techniques to transfer the city/airline information to the new dummy dataframe and to model the feature importances.


### **[Capstone, Part 2: Technologies and algorithms used](./part-02/README.md)**

Data Collection, EDA & visualization:

Python packages: Pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, ELI5, Scikit-Learn

Machine Learning Algorithms: Decision Tree, Logistics Regression, Random Forest

NLP: TF/IDF 

### **[Capstone, Part 3: Project Achievement](./part-03/README.md)**

Through EDA analysis, I Obtained insights of flight delaying frequencies that grouped by various features such as date, airline/cities, aircraft types and flying distances.

Models brought high levels of accuracy, and shown the feature importances match with the EDA insights.


### **[Capstone, Part 4: Future Development](./part-04/README.md)**

Moving Forward, I will try to access weather information by web-scrapping or API accessment, and to merge with existing flight records to obtain better model performance and hidden important features.
